Zappr is a GitHub integration built to enhance your project workflow. Built by open-source enthusiasts,
it's aimed at helping developers to increase productivity and improve open-source project quality.
It does this primarily by removing bottlenecks around pull request approval and helping project owners to
halt "rogue" pull requests before they're merged into the master branch.
