# Contributing to Zappr

We are happy to accept your contributions to make Zappr better and more awesome! To avoid unnecessary work on either side, please stick to the following process:

1. Check if there is already [an issue](https://github.com/zalando/zappr/issues) for your concern.
2. If there is not, open a new one to start a discussion. We hate to close finished PRs!
3. If we decide your concern needs code changes, we would be happy to accept a pull request. Please consider the commit guidelines below.

In case you just want to help out and don't know where to start, [issues with "help wanted" label](https://github.com/zalando/zappr/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3A%22help%20wanted%22) are good for first-time contributors. 

## Git Commit Guidelines

If there is already a ticket, use this number at the start of your commit message. This is [automatically checked with Zappr](https://zappr.readthedocs.org/en/latest/setup/#commit-messages)!

Use [semantic commit messages](http://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages):

* feat (new feature)
* fix (bug fix)
* docs (changes to documentation)
* style (formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change)
* refactor (refactoring production code)
* test (adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change)
* chore (updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change)

**Example:** `#42 feat: This is my new feature.`
